**The Enabling Analysis in the Cloud Using NASA Earth Science Data will take place on Sunday, December 10 from 13:00-16:30**.   

**Zoom links** will be shared directly with this group via a (calendar) meeting invite.

**Note,** hands-on exercises will be executed from a **Jupyter Lab instance in 2i2c.** [Click here to deploy the instance](https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNASA-Openscapes%2F2023-Cloud-Workshop-AGU&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2F2023-Cloud-Workshop-AGU%2FREADME.md&branch=main) and simultaneously clone this GitHub repository to follow along with the tutorials. Please pass along your GitHub Username to get access.

## Closing - Close out your Jupyter Hub!

- Close out your JupyterHub instance if you are finished for the day, following [these instructions](https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/tutorials/00_Setup.html#how-do-i-end-my-session). 
- You will continue to have access to the 2i2c JupyterHub in AWS for two weeks following this Workshop. You may use that time to continue work and all learn more about migrating data access routines and science workflows to the Cloud. This cloud compute environment is supported by the [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/) project.
